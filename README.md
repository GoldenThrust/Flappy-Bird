# 🐦 Flappy Bird Neural Network AI

An educational Flappy Bird game built to understand how **neural networks** make decisions in real time.  
The bird learns how to survive by processing game state data and deciding when to flap.

This project focuses on **learning AI concepts**, not graphics or game polish.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to:
- Learn how neural networks work
- Understand decision-making in game AI
- Explore evolutionary learning
- Apply AI concepts in a fun and visual way

---

## 🧠 How the Neural Network Works

Each bird is controlled by a simple neural network.

---

## 🧬 Learning Method

The birds learn using **evolutionary learning (genetic algorithm)**:

1. Multiple birds are spawned with random neural networks
2. Birds that survive longer get higher scores
3. Best-performing networks are selected
4. New generations are created through mutation
5. Performance improves over time
